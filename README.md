## Bone Capture blend
A tool to allow users to easily blend between multiple sets of weights.

## Use Case
Here you have a rigged character who has multiple sets of armor. You dont want to weight paint each set of armor manually but transfering the weights isnt cutting it.
Here you can see the transferred weights are clipping into the mesh.

You try generating new automatic weights from the skeleton onto the armor but it looks like this...

Its better but the skirt is all messed up. Ideally you can pick exactly which weights you want from each bind. With my tool you can!
